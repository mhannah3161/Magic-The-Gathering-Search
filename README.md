## User Story
AS A Magic The Gathering enthusiast
 <br>
 <br>
I WANT an app that uses login functionality
<br>
<br>
SO THAT I can look up cards to make my decks better


## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to improve on an existing project known as Knockoff Gatherer 1.0  by adding more features (link to previous GitHub reposistory down below). Some of the new features include creating custom decks and adding collections of cards for easier viewieng at a later time. Below is a screen shot of the new main page.


There have been many backend updates to this application and many frontend updates as well. On the frontend, React is the primary library used for rendering client side views. Mongodb and Mongoose were used for the backend to create the database for the cards, collections and decks.
